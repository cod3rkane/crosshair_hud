# crosshair_hud

Cod3r's custom Crosshair app

## TODO and Ideas

we can create a simple statistics with things like clicks, pressed keys, mouse movement etc..
another nice thing could be show another layer on top when a combo keys are pressed to switch the crosshair or exit the app

we also could add some sort of timer, like create a timer and display on screen, so we can time the reset of monuments e.g for rust
it'd be nice to also add some tools for this app, useful tools e.g for rust and other games
